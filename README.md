## ROS Quality Hub
ROS Quality Hub is an online community hub that will provide a focal point and resources to foster greater quality related activity and bring the community together to improve the quality and quality practices within ROS and RIS-Industrial communities.

### Patterns

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. We used this concept to document ROS quality issues and the proposed solutions for these issues.
